# Spam-Message-Detector
This is a basic machine learning project to classify text messages as Spam or Not Spam. The project uses Python, scikit-learn, and CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical features for model training. The model is trained on a small sample dataset and demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline of text classification.
